# (M)jir Map Platformer

Map format for a platformer I am making

# Features
Somewhat extensible, but no out-of-box support for it.
Parallax layers

# Design
I want this to be somewhat efficient, there are two types of files, the .jrmp file that
holds compact data, and the other files (like header, tiles) that hold data that's easier
to edit
